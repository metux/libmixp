Abstract
--------
libmixp is an tiny 9p2000 library which originally came from the
"window manager improved-improved" package [1], which provides 
an X11 window manager with 9P-based[2] remote control.

This package now provides an standalone library no dependencies
(besides the usual build tools ;-)), building as shared object
and as static/ar as well, including an pkg-config descriptor.


Requirements
------------
An common GNU environment should work well. Other *nix'es may also
work, but not tested. Please report if you tried other targts than
GNU/Linux.


Installation
------------

To build, simply run:
	make

To install, run the following, as root, if necessary:
	make install

Some parameters can be specified via environment:

    DESTDIR	 the destination prefix on installation (ie. for packaging)
    PREFIX	 (fhs-style) install dir prefix (default: /usr)
    LIBDIR	 (fhs-style) library dir        (default: $PREFIX/lib)
    INCLUDEDIR	 (fhs-style) include dir        (default: $PREFIX/include)
    PKGCONFIGDIR directory for the .pc file     (default: $LIBDIR/pkgconfig)
    CC		 path to the C compiler (may need GNU semantics)
    AR           path to the ar tool
    RANLIB       path to the ranlib tool


Tesing libmixp
-------------

The package contains an minimalistic test client in the cmd/ subdir.
It's not built automatically. Just chdir to cmd/ and run make.
